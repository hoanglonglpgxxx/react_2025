# Watched Movies list app - Fetching API

## Split UI into CPNs

- Split small but no too small => ez to understand and maintain
- Start with big, then split it into smaller cpns

## Prop Drilling

- The problem when pass data through several CPNs

## CPN Composition

## useEffect cleanup: run khi effect được chạy lại hoặc CHỈ SAU khi CPN unmounted

## React Hooks: các special built-in func, always start with "use"

## Refs dùng cho data NOT cho render
